                    <p id="info-content">In the beginning there was chaos, the galaxy was at war as it usually is when a child was born. He was born on a starship too a family of 
                        refugees fleeing the invading Minmater forces. During his birth his mother suffered complications and as his father the famous 
                        Capsuleer SirMolle was off fighting in the brutal Great War against the independent Null-Sec nation of GoonSwarm, Deckhard was placed in the
                        care of the Captain of the transport vessel. Raised under the Captain, Deckhard grew and learned the intricacies of intersteller travel and the politics of 
                        galaxy. When the Captain was old and frail he called Deckhard to his cabin and as he lay there weakly he told Deckhard the truth of his birth and that 
                        he was the son of the great SirMolle who by this time had been defeated and executed by the Goonswarm Leadership. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Upon Learning this shocking information Deckhard made the decision to leave the transporter, not out of anger or malice, but to seek his true 
                        place in the galaxy as a capsuleer he claimed his rightful status and through a long and arduous string of events he carved out his empire piece 
                        by piece, collecting wealth and knowledge along the way until he founded our glorious Corporate Empire The Cwn Annwn.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Founding our Empire in a small region of space near Nakri Deckhard and his followers lived a nomadic life raiding neighbouring and rival Corporations in the 
                        Gallente low-sec Regions, eventually moving to the null-sec region of Fountain to claim our own territory.
